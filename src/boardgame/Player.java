/**
 * Base class for a board game player. Do not modify this class, extend it
 * instead. Override the chooseMove() method to pick moves to play.
 *
 * The client software needs to know what board to use, and uses the
 * createBoard() method for this. The default implementation creates a
 * BreakThrough board, and needs only be changed to play a different game. This
 * should be the same board class as used by the server.
 *
 * The client software maintains a copy of the board and updates it as moves are
 * received from the server.
 *
 * Implementations must provide a default _public_ constructor taking no
 * arguments.
 *
 * Initialization should be done by overriding the gameStarted() method, since
 * the player's color is not known during construction. Override the gameOver()
 * method for any cleanup tasks. You may also override the movePlayed() method
 * to be notified whenever a move is received from the server.
 *
 * See the BohnenspielRandomPlayer class for an example implementation.
